(First question)
Milo: Wow!, wonderful question the main characters of this game are Ayla and Mo. You can ask me about them indiviually if you want.
Milo: Oh, traveler! How can you not know about our two adventurers! Well have no worry, the two characters are Mo and Ayla!
Milo: The two main characters of this story are Ayla and Mo.

(Second question)
Milo: Ah!, Ayla is a peculiar character she's a wizard to say the least. (ask again to get a full backstory)
Milo: It's sad truly, Ayla is a female wizard with pink hair and eyes, half dragon/human. Her family died when she was two and she was taken in by a wizard named Lucky. When Ayla turned eight, she was told that she is from a wizard family and ever since then she was trained by Lucky. When Ayla turned eleven, she found out that a warlock near her home was the one that killed her parents. She went to go attack him herself, but she was trying to angerly kill him with her powers then captured her. 
Milo: Ayla she's one of my creators, ah... not that Ayla? Ask me again I know I can do it!

(Third question) 
Milo:  Traveler, A wondrous adventure she is. A master with a bow! (ask again to get a full backstory)
Milo: Mo is a female magical archer with blonde hair, bunny/human with brown eyes. Her family is famous for having magic through their bows and arrows. Her family trained her to be and archer, then her family was attacked by a warlock named Luchster who killed her family and then kidnapped her.
Milo: Mo is one of the creators of this game, of me! Oh? Not the answer you were looking for. Ask me again, I promise I will get it right this time!

(Forth question)
Milo: Mo is a ranger, although she does have magical bows and arrows. Sometimes they can be flame arrows, increased attack, or sometimes she just shoots faster!
Milo: Mo has many abilities! Some are just basic attack or speed buff, but others are flame arrows or ice arrows! Pretty cool, if you ask me.

(Fifth question) 
Milo: Ayla is a wizard, she has many spells and book that has even more than she knows!
Milo: Ayla is a Wizard, although still only an apprentice she knows many flame spells.

(Sixth question)
Milo: Oh my! I can't tell you the ending of the game. You'll have to play it traveler, but ask me again if this wasn't what you wanted
Milo: Oh! So you know there are more than one ending well I suppose since you asked about it. There are two endings right now, but I just know there will be more!

(Seventh question) 
Milo: Oh we're talking technical now! Well you've asked the right bot. So once you open the game you'll click start, then you just read and choose the options you feel are best!
Milo: I see this isn't a story question. Do you have a mouse/trackpad Traveler? Well if you answered yes, then you should be able to play the game easy peasy! If no, how did you get to me to begin with... Have fun with the game.

(Eigth question)
Milo: In my program it says that this is a story based game. Therefore you will choose different options throughout the game. Be-careful the choices you make, will influence your ending and other options.

(Ninth question) 
Milo: I'm shocked or I would be if I was programmed for emotion other than the satisfactory of you, Traveler. Anyway as the shock of that question I found in my program that there are over 50 options in this story!
Milo: I'm a robot, not a math genius! Although my creators did program me with the knowledge to answer all your questions! There are over 50 options in total to choose from with 2-3 options per a scene.

(Tenth question) 
Milo: You can play as two characters, there is one villain, a few side characters. If this wasn't exactly what you wanted ask me the question again!
Milo: You can play as two characters in the game! There is one Villain name luchster, then there a few side characters that can be found more about if you play the game. Atleast that is what my program is telling me!

(Eleventh question)
Milo: I'm so happy, I think... That you asked this question this story is why I have been created! The story is about two girls who got captured by this evil Warlock, the goal is to work together to escape the warlocks tower! You should try playing it to see what it’s really like.

(Twelveth question) 
Milo: I'm long very long. Oh, wait I am tall! That wasn't your question... This game should take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Depending on the reading and clicking speed time may vary.
Milo: Short, oh long? Depending on the reading and clicking speed of you. Which in humans it does vary, the time should be different. Although on average it takes about 5 minutes to complete!

(Thirteenth question)
Milo: Right now this game is single player, with two characters to choose from at the beginning. But my creators made me! So they can make more characters for you to choose from in the future.

(Fourteenth question) 
Milo: I don't play as anyone! I'm joking, it's what you humans do. Once you click begin and watch the intro you then choose between the two main characters.
Milo: You either play as Ayla or Mo. The two main adventurers in this story game!

(Fifteenth question)
Milo: This story takes place in the country of Asmary and the village of Luna. In my program it says these are made up places made up by my creators.

(Sixteenth question) 
Milo: That’s a fantastic question, Traveler! This story is set in its own alternate universe, but I suppose in your world it could be set around 1300-1400s.

(Seventeenth question)
Milo: The game is called The Journey of the Ranger and the Wizard.
Milo: I am too a little confused, but there is one thing for certain this game is called The Journey of the Ranger and the Wizard.

(Eigteenth question) 
Milo: Traveler, the title of this adventure is The Journey of the Ranger and the Wizard because one of the characters is a wizard and a ranger! In my opinion (don’t tell my superiors, it’s not the best title).

(Ninteenth question) 
Milo: Yes! As of right now there are only two characters, there is an option before you start the story to choose which character you would like to play as.

(Twenty question)
Milo: The games creators are Mo and Ayla. Who are also the two main characters, funny! Right? Ha... Ha...

(Twenty one question) 
Milo: I'm a robot, and although I can't actually laugh I can make you laugh! What kind of tree fits in your hand, a palm tree
Milo: You wanted a joke? I'm sorry all I have is a pencil so what's even the point.
Milo: I'm not programmed to be funny, but I am programed to help you so what did the fish say when it hit a wall, Dam.

(Else) 
Milo: Hi Traveler I'm not able to understand that currently, but I might in the future.
Milo: I don't understand! Please rephrase your question.
Milo: Try asking questions such as 'Who are the main characters?
Milo: I'm sorry my creators haven't programmed me for that kind of question yet.
